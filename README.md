## Usage

You have the choice to Sign-Up for an account using the Sign-Up button in the navigation bar which will ask for an email, password, display name and diet preference. This will be stored in the firebase user collection as well as a realtime database, in the future will be used to help display only recipes that meet your diet preference.

By inputing the ingredients you wish to use in the input bar and clicking search recipes 6 recipes will be generated using those ingredients. Clicking on a picture of the recipe a modal will open that will include the title, ingredients, directions and a chart showing the amount and percent of macro nutrients in the dish (fats, protiens and carbs).
